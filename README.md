# M5StickC_Plus_Slot_Machine
Tweaks to make the M5Stick-C Slot machine work on Plus version.

I've simply increased the sprite size of the screen for the C Plus.            

I've increased the height of the spool shadow.                 

I've also added a fourth spool as it was supported in the well written code. I noticed there was no easy way to scale the sprites using M5 graphics, and the Lucky 7 icon original is missing on the hosting site.
